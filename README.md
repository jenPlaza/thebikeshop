Cycle Bike Shop World is an undergraduate assignment part of the Website Design and Development degree program at Full Sail University (September 2019).

Cycle Bike Shop World is a responsive app that currently adapts to desktop, tablets, and mobile platforms. The project assests included materials similar to those that would be found when collaborating with a design team. The project’s purpose was to develop strudent’s creative thinking abilities.

Cycle Bike Shop World inluded a design idea in which supplemental pages had to be inspired using validated and proper HTML semantics. The Home page features most popular products, member benefits, and site-map links. The e-commerce page fetches products and description using an Ajax Api call that parses a json object. The events page includes a horizontal gallery with event images and descriptions.The website has been tested on Safari and Chrome, to provide the user with a seamless user experience.
